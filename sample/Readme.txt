Transmitter: Thinkpad x1
Receiver: IPhone SE

The code has two parts:

The transmitter part generates a sound track stored in output_track. You can uncomment sound() to play it with your speaker. 

The receiver part takes the input either from the recorded sound wave or from the output_track generated by the transmitter part. Uncomment % output_track = soundTrack'; to switch the input.
