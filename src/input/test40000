Finally we reached a point where we have to test if we can transfer 10,000 bits, which should be 1250 characters, successfully. Writing them is not easy but we have to write that much length to test. Currently 2,000 bits has been successful. I think I need to use "A quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog" to fill the space. But before that, let's talk about how tiresome this project is becoming. Weeks ago all I know about java is it's spelling, but now we are having a project with 1,000 lines of code, WELCOME TO SHANGHAITECH. Still, I don't think acoustic network is a good idea, as it transfers slow, and it's unstable. The unstability has been proved by us this morning, when we realized that the microphone and the soundbar have to be placed at certain point when the transmission can be possible. However, I was thinking if we can boost the frequency to 1,000,000,000Hz, then the speed can come up and things will be easier. Any way, I waived a week without GRE3000 and other funny stuff just to write is somewhat exausting. It's spring and today is sunny, I want to go out, get some sunlight and have fun, not sitting here and write java codes. Also, I we don't need Mr.Fox and Mr.Dog after all, thank you fellows for jumping over and over.Finally we reached a point where we have to test if we can transfer 10,000 bits, which should be 1250 characters, successfully.
